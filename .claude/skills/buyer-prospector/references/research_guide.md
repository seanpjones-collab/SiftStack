## LLC Research

LLCs are the most common entity type in real estate buyer data. The goal is to find the **members** (owners) or **managers** (operators) of the LLC.

### Primary Source: Secretary of State

Every LLC must register with the Secretary of State in its formation state. The `BuyerState` column indicates where to search.

**What to look for:**
- **Registered Agent**: The official contact for the LLC. Often the owner or their attorney.
- **Members/Managers**: Some states list these on formation documents or annual reports.
- **Principal Address**: May differ from the mailing address in your data.
- **Organizer**: The person who filed the formation documents (may be the owner or a third party).

**Research Steps:**
1. Go to the SOS website for the state in `BuyerState`
2. Use the business entity search function
3. Search for the exact LLC name from `BuyerFullName`
4. Click on the entity to view details
5. Look for annual reports or amendments (often have more current info)
6. Document the Registered Agent name and any listed members/managers

**Example:**
```
Input: GDP PROPERTIES LLC (TN)

Tennessee SOS Search:
- Entity Name: GDP PROPERTIES LLC
- Status: Active
- Formation Date: 01/15/2019
- Registered Agent: JOHN DOE
- Principal Address: 11002 Kingston Pike Ste 203, Farragut, TN 37934

Result:
DecisionMaker_Name: John Doe
DecisionMaker_Role: Registered Agent
Verification_Source: TN SOS Business Search
```

### Anonymous LLC States

Some states allow anonymous LLCs where member names are not disclosed: **Delaware, New Mexico, Nevada, Wyoming**. For these, the Registered Agent is often a commercial service, not the actual owner.

**Workaround for Anonymous LLCs:**
1. Check if the LLC owns property in a non-anonymous state
2. Search county deed records for properties owned by the LLC
3. The deed may show the signer's name
4. Contact the Registered Agent directly (may or may not provide info)

## Corporation Research

Corporations (Inc, Corp) have a more formal structure with officers and directors.

### Primary Source: Secretary of State

**What to look for:**
- **Officers**: President, CEO, Secretary, Treasurer
- **Directors**: Board members
- **Registered Agent**: Official contact
- **Annual Reports**: Most current officer information

**Research Steps:**
1. Go to the SOS website for the state in `BuyerState`
2. Search for the corporation name
3. View the entity details and any filed annual reports
4. Document the President or CEO as the primary decision-maker

**Example:**
```
Input: DR HORTON INC (TN)

Note: DR Horton is a large public homebuilder. For large corporations,
the local division manager is often more relevant than corporate officers.

For smaller corporations:
DecisionMaker_Name: [President Name from SOS]
DecisionMaker_Role: President
Verification_Source: [State] SOS Annual Report
```

## Trust Research

Trusts are private documents and are NOT registered with the Secretary of State. Finding the trustee requires different methods.

### Method 1: Trust Name Analysis

Many trust names reveal the trustee or grantor:

| Trust Name Pattern | Likely Trustee |
|-------------------|----------------|
| SMITH FAMILY TRUST | Someone named Smith |
| JOHN DOE REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST | John Doe |
| JANE DOE REVOCABLE TRUST | Jane Doe |
| THE [NAME] TRUST | Person with that name |

**For Revocable Living Trusts:** The grantor (creator) is almost always the initial trustee. The name in the trust title is typically the decision-maker.

**Example:**
```
Input: BENNETT REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST

Analysis: "Revocable Living Trust" indicates the grantor is the trustee.
The name "Bennett" is the grantor's surname.

Result:
DecisionMaker_Name: [First Name] Bennett
DecisionMaker_Role: Trustee/Grantor
Verification_Source: Trust naming convention analysis
Note: First name needed - search county records or skip trace "Bennett" at the trust's mailing address
```

### Method 2: County Deed Records

When a property is transferred into a trust, the deed is recorded with the county. The deed shows the trustee's name.

**Research Steps:**
1. Identify the county where the trust owns property
2. Find the county recorder/register of deeds website
3. Search by the trust name or property address
4. Locate the deed where the trust is the grantee (buyer)
5. The trustee's name appears on the deed, often as "John Smith, Trustee of the Smith Family Trust"

### Method 3: Mailing Address Skip Trace

If the trust has a residential mailing address (not a PO Box), the person at that address is likely the trustee.

## Estate Research

Estates indicate a deceased owner. The decision-maker is the **Executor** or **Personal Representative**.

### Primary Source: Probate Court

Estate cases are handled by the probate court in the county where the deceased resided.

**Research Steps:**
1. Identify the county from your data
2. Find the county probate court website
3. Search for the estate case by the deceased's name
4. The court records will name the Executor/Personal Representative

**Note:** Estate buyers are less common in active buyer lists. If an estate is actively purchasing properties, it may be an investment entity using "Estate" in its name rather than an actual probate estate.

## Tips for Efficient Research

1. **Batch by State**: Group entities by `BuyerState` to research multiple entities on the same SOS website.

2. **Start with High-Volume Buyers**: Prioritize entities with the highest `BuyerPurchases6MSum` values—these are your most active buyers.

3. **Use Browser Tabs**: Open multiple SOS search results in tabs to compare and verify information.

4. **Document Everything**: Even if you can't find the decision-maker, note what you searched and why it failed. This helps with future research.

5. **Cross-Reference**: If the Registered Agent is a commercial service (like CT Corporation, CSC, etc.), the actual owner is not disclosed. Try searching county deed records instead.
