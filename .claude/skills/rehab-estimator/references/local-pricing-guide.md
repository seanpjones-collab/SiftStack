# Local Pricing Guide — Market-Specific Cost Calibration

National averages are useful baselines, but the actual cost to rehab a property varies dramatically by market. A $40K rehab in Dayton, OH might cost $80K+ in Denver, CO for the same scope of work. This guide provides the methodology for localizing every line item.

Top-of-market labor and regulatory costs.

| Market Examples | Typical Multiplier | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| San Francisco, CA | 1.55 | Highest in nation for labor |
| Los Angeles, CA | 1.40 | High labor, earthquake retrofit costs |

## How to Apply the Multiplier

The multiplier applies differently to labor vs materials:

**Labor component** (typically 40-60% of line item cost): Apply full multiplier.
**Material component** (typically 40-60% of line item cost): Apply 50% of the multiplier deviation from 1.0.

### Example
National average for LVP flooring install: $5.00/SF (mid)
- Assume 50/50 labor/material split: $2.50 labor + $2.50 material
- Dayton, OH multiplier: 0.82
- Labor adjustment: $2.50 × 0.82 = $2.05
- Material adjustment: $2.50 × (1 + (0.82 - 1.0) × 0.5) = $2.50 × 0.91 = $2.28
- Local price: $2.05 + $2.28 = **$4.33/SF** (vs $5.00 national)

### Simplified Method
For speed, you can apply the multiplier to the full line item when the split isn't worth calculating individually. The blended approach introduces ~5% error which is acceptable for estimation.

## Permit Cost Research

Permit costs are one of the most variable local factors. They range from $100 for a simple cosmetic permit in a rural county to $5,000+ for a major renovation permit in a strict urban jurisdiction.

### How to Research
1. Search: `"[City]" OR "[County]" building permit fees schedule`
2. Check the city/county building department website directly
3. Look for the published fee schedule (usually a PDF)
4. Note whether permits require licensed contractors (some cities do)

### Common Permit Triggers
| Work Type | Typically Requires Permit |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Structural changes | Always |
| Electrical panel work | Always |
| Plumbing rough-in changes | Always |
| HVAC system replacement | Usually |
| Roof replacement | Often (varies by jurisdiction) |
| Window replacement (same size) | Sometimes |
| Cosmetic only (paint, flooring, cabinets) | Rarely |
| Water heater replacement | Often |
