## Workflow Overview

1. Determine analysis type (Quick Research vs. Comprehensive Analysis)
2. Get FRED baseline for Days on Market
3. Login to Sift and extract Market Map data
4. For Comprehensive Analysis: gather public data and blend with Market Map data
5. Generate output (spreadsheet or full market report)

**Quick Research?** -> Follow Steps 1-7 below for Sift data extraction only
**Comprehensive Analysis?** -> Follow all steps, then see `references/ComprehensiveAnalysisFramework.md`

## Step 1: Get FRED National Baseline

Before analyzing markets, get the national Days on Market baseline from FRED:
- Search for "Median Days on Market" at fred.stlouisfed.org
- Current baseline is approximately **73 days** (verify for accuracy)
- Markets 15-20% below this baseline indicate faster-moving markets

## Step 2: Login to Sift

1. Navigate to `https://app.reisift.io/`
2. Enter email: `ty+2@dataflik.com`
3. Enter password: `Marco25.Soccer99!`
4. Check the "I agree to the Terms of Use" checkbox
5. Click "Sign In" button
6. Dismiss any notification popups that appear
7. Wait for dashboard to load

## Step 3: Navigate to Market Finder

1. From dashboard, click "Market Finder" in the left sidebar navigation
2. The interface shows:
   - **Top filters**: Select States -> Select Counties -> ZIP Codes/Neighborhoods toggle -> Select ZIP Codes -> Property Type
   - **Heat map**: Interactive US map with color-coded investor transaction density
   - **Legend**: Mo. Investor Transactions dropdown (can switch to Homes Sold, Median Sale Price, Homes on Market, Days on Market)
   - **Data table**: State/County/Zip level data with columns for investor transactions, homes on market, homes sold, days on market, median values
   - **Right panel**: Summary cards (Median Home Value, Homes on Market, Mo. Investor Transactions, Homes Sold Last Month) plus Home Prices distribution, Homeownership Rate, Market Rent, Gross Rental Yield, Property Types, Bedrooms, Year Built

**Navigation Flow:**
- Default view shows all US states ranked by investor transactions
- Click "Select States" dropdown -> select target state -> view updates to show counties
- Click "Select Counties" dropdown -> select target county -> view updates to show zip codes
- ZIP Codes toggle switches between ZIP Codes and Neighborhoods view

## Step 4: State-Level Analysis

The default view shows states sorted by "Total Inv. Trans. for 6 Mo." (investor transactions).

**Top States by Investor Activity (as of Jan 2026):**
| State | 6-Mo Investor Trans | Days on Market | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| Texas | 41,709 | 65 | Highest activity |
| Florida | 27,131 | 73 | At FRED baseline |
| California | 15,613 | 41 | Fast market |
| Georgia | 12,299 | 59 | Below baseline |
| North Carolina | 11,869 | 60 | Below baseline |
| Ohio | 11,311 | 45 | Fast market |
| Tennessee | 6,830 | 62 | Below baseline |

**Green Light Criteria:**
- Days on Market at or 15-20% below FRED baseline (~58-62 days)
- 500+ investor transactions in 6 months
- Reasonable inventory levels

**Red Flags:**
- Days on Market 50%+ above national average
- Less than 10 investor transactions in 6 months

**To analyze a state:**
1. Click the "Select States" dropdown
2. Select your target state from the alphabetical list
3. The map zooms to show county-level data
4. Data table updates to show counties ranked by investor transactions

## Step 5: County-Level Analysis

After selecting a state, the data table shows counties with these columns:
- **County**: County name
- **Total Inv. Trans. for 6 Mo.**: 6-month investor transaction count
- **Homes on Market**: Current inventory
- **Homes Sold Last Month**: Recent sales volume
- **Median Days on Market**: Average time to sell
- **Median Home Value**: Current values
- **Median Sale Price**: Recent sale prices

**Example - Tennessee Counties:**
| County | 6-Mo Inv Trans | Homes on Market | Homes Sold | Days on Market |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| Shelby (Memphis) | 1,306 | 4,200+ | 937 | 58 |
| Davidson (Nashville) | 683 | 4,172 | 853 | 59 |
| Knox (Knoxville) | 462 | 2,700+ | 668 | 57 |
| Hamilton (Chattanooga) | 449 | 2,800+ | 538 | 56 |

**Evaluation Criteria:**
| Metric | Ideal Range | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| 6-Month Investor Transactions | 50+ | Indicates active market |
| Monthly Investor Transactions | 10+ | Minimum for wholesaling |
| Days on Market | Below state avg | Faster-moving |
| Supply (Months of Inventory) | 3-6 months | Balanced market |

**Calculate Supply (Burn Rate):**
```
Supply = Homes on Market / Monthly Sales Volume
```

- Under 3 months = Seller's market (fast)
- 3-6 months = Balanced market
- Over 6 months = Buyer's market (slow)

**To drill down to zip codes:**
1. Click the "Select Counties" dropdown
2. Select your target county (format: "County Name STATE")
3. The map zooms to show zip code boundaries
4. Data table updates to show zip codes ranked by investor transactions

## Step 6: Zip Code & Neighborhood Data Extraction

After selecting a county, the data table shows either ZIP codes or Neighborhoods (toggle between views).

### Data Extraction Rules

1. **Capture ALL visible rows** - Scroll through the entire table to capture all data
2. **Use EXACT column headers** - Do not rename or abbreviate columns
3. **Preserve data types** - Keep currency formatting with $ and commas
4. **Capture BOTH views** - Extract ZIP Code AND Neighborhood data when available
5. **Note the sort order** - Default sort is by "TOTAL INV. TRANS. FOR 6 MO." descending

### Right Panel Summary Data

Also capture the summary cards from the right panel:
- **Median Home Value**: e.g., $364.4K
- **Homes on Market**: e.g., 2.8K
- **Mo. Investor Transactions**: e.g., 53
- **Homes Sold Last Month**: e.g., 668
- **Market Rent**: e.g., $2,107/mo
- **Gross Rental Yield**: e.g., 7.07%

**Property Characteristics Button:**
Click "Calculate recommended property characteristics" button to get AI-recommended property filters for the selected area.

## Step 7: Create Excel Spreadsheet Output

**ALWAYS create an Excel workbook (.xlsx) with 7 properly formatted worksheets.**

The output spreadsheet should be a complete, self-contained market report that an investor can open and immediately understand the opportunity. The 7-sheet structure mirrors a professional research deliverable: start with the executive summary for quick decision-making, then let the reader drill into ZIP/neighborhood data, economic fundamentals, safety, and actionable recommendations.

Use Python with openpyxl to create the spreadsheet:

```python
import openpyxl
from openpyxl.styles import Font, Alignment, Border, Side, PatternFill
from datetime import datetime

wb = openpyxl.Workbook()

# Style definitions
header_font = Font(bold=True, color="FFFFFF")
header_fill = PatternFill(start_color="4472C4", end_color="4472C4", fill_type="solid")
border = Border(
    left=Side(style='thin'),
    right=Side(style='thin'),
    top=Side(style='thin'),
    bottom=Side(style='thin')
)
```

### Required Worksheets (7 Sheets)

The workbook must contain exactly these 7 sheets, in this order. Each sheet serves a distinct purpose in telling the market story.

---

#### Sheet 1: Executive Summary

This is the first thing the investor sees. It should answer: "Is this market worth my time, and where specifically should I focus?" in under 60 seconds of reading.

**Structure:**

**Row 1**: Report title — `[COUNTY], [STATE] - MARKET RESEARCH REPORT` (merged across columns A-E)
**Row 2**: Generation date
**Row 3**: Data source attribution — `Data Source: REI Sift Market Finder + Public Data Sources`

**Section A: County Overview (starts row 5)**
A table with columns: Metric | Value | Notes

Include these metrics (pulled from Sift right panel + public sources):
| Metric | Source | Notes Column Example |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Population (latest year) | Census | `+X.X% since 2020` |
| Median Home Value | Sift | `REI Sift data` |
| Median Household Income | Census ACS | `Census ACS` |
| Unemployment Rate | BLS | `BLS [Month Year]` |
| Homes on Market | Sift | `REI Sift data` |
| Monthly Investor Transactions | Sift | `6-month average` |
| Homes Sold Last Month | Sift | `REI Sift data` |
| Market Rent | Sift | `REI Sift data` |
| Gross Rental Yield | Sift | `REI Sift data` |
| Homeownership Rate | Census/Sift | `Renters: XX.X%` |
| Months of Supply | Calculated | `Homes on Market / Homes Sold` |
| National Days on Market | FRED | `FRED baseline` |

**Section B: Market Assessment (starts ~row 19)**
A qualitative ratings table with columns: Category | Rating | Commentary

Rate each category as HIGH, MODERATE, LOW, STRONG, STABLE, IMPROVING, DECLINING, etc.:
| Category | What to assess |
|----------|---------------|
| Investor Activity | Monthly transaction volume, wholesaling viability |
| Market Velocity | Median DOM relative to national average |
| Price Appreciation | YoY price trend from Redfin |
| Population Growth | Census growth rate and migration patterns |
| Employment | Unemployment rate, job growth |
| Crime Trend | Direction of crime stats (improving/worsening) |

The commentary column should be a brief, specific explanation — not generic filler. For example: `53 monthly transactions, strong wholesaling market` rather than `Good activity level`.

**Section C: Top 5 ZIP Codes for Wholesaling (starts ~row 28)**
Columns: Rank | ZIP Code | 6-Mo Inv Trans | Median Home Value | Days on Market

Pull the top 5 ZIPs sorted by investor transactions.

**Section D: Top 5 Neighborhoods for Wholesaling (starts ~row 36)**
Columns: Rank | Neighborhood | 6-Mo Inv Trans | Median Home Value | Days on Market

Pull the top 5 neighborhoods sorted by investor transactions.

---

#### Sheet 2: ZIP Code Analysis

This is the deep-dive data sheet. Every ZIP code in the county gets a row, sorted by investor transactions descending. The calculated columns (DOM vs National, Spread %, Supply Months, Wholesaling Score) are what turn raw Sift data into actionable intelligence.

**Columns (in order):**
| Col | Header | Source | Description |
|-----|--------|--------|-------------|
| A | ZIP Code | Sift | 5-digit ZIP |
| B | 6-Mo Inv Trans | Sift | Total investor transactions for 6 months |
| C | Homes on Market | Sift | Current inventory |
| D | Homes Sold/Mo | Sift | Homes sold last month |
| E | Median DOM | Sift | Median days on market |
| F | DOM vs National | **Calculated** | `= Median DOM - FRED baseline` (negative = faster than national) |
| G | Median Home Value | Sift | Currency formatted |
| H | Median Sale Price | Sift | Currency formatted |
| I | Spread % | **Calculated** | `= (Median Sale Price - Median Home Value) / Median Home Value` — shows the gap between list and sale prices. Negative spread = buyers negotiating below list (opportunity). Large positive spread = competitive/premium market. |
| J | Supply Months | **Calculated** | `= Homes on Market / Homes Sold/Mo` — months of inventory at current sales pace |
| K | Wholesaling Score | **Calculated** | Star rating (see scoring methodology below) |

**Wholesaling Score Methodology:**

The star rating is a composite score that answers: "How attractive is this ZIP code for a wholesaler?" It weighs three factors:

1. **Investor Activity** (primary signal) — Higher 6-month investor transactions = more proven buyer demand
2. **Market Velocity** (secondary) — DOM below national average = properties move quickly, reducing hold risk
3. **Price Accessibility** (tertiary) — Lower median home values = smaller capital requirements and broader buyer pool

**Scoring rubric:**
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| ★★★★★ | 30+ inv trans AND DOM 15+ days below national AND median value under $350K |
| ★★★★☆ | 20+ inv trans AND DOM below national AND median value under $400K (or 30+ trans with higher prices) |
| ★★★☆☆ | 10+ inv trans AND DOM near or below national (meets 2 of 3 criteria solidly) |
| ★★☆☆☆ | Some investor activity but higher prices, slower DOM, or limited volume |
| ★☆☆☆☆ | Low activity, DOM above national, or anomalous data (e.g., very high sale price outliers) |

Use judgment — these thresholds are guidelines. A ZIP with 35 investor transactions but $600K+ median values might be ★★★☆☆ because the price point limits the wholesale buyer pool, even though volume is strong.

**Formatting notes:**
- Spread % should show sign: `-12.5%` or `+11.5%`
- DOM vs National should show sign: `-19` or `+34`
- Supply Months to 1 decimal: `4.4`
- Star ratings as text: `★★★★★`, `★★★★☆`, etc.

---

#### Sheet 3: Neighborhood Analysis

Identical structure to Sheet 2, but for neighborhoods instead of ZIP codes. Same columns, same calculated fields, same scoring methodology.

| Col | Header |
|-----|--------|
| A | Neighborhood |
| B | 6-Mo Inv Trans |
| C | Homes on Market |
| D | Homes Sold/Mo |
| E | Median DOM |
| F | DOM vs National |
| G | Median Home Value |
| H | Median Sale Price |
| I | Spread % |
| J | Supply Months |
| K | Wholesaling Score |

Include ALL neighborhoods from Sift (typically 20-30 rows), sorted by investor transactions descending.

---

#### Sheet 4: Economic Indicators

This sheet provides the macroeconomic context that explains WHY the market behaves as it does. An investor needs to know: Is the local economy healthy? Are jobs growing? Is the population stable or growing?

Organize into 3 sections:

**Section A: Employment Data (BLS)**
Pull from BLS (bls.gov/eag) for the county's MSA:
Columns: Metric | Value | Trend

| Metric | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Civilian Labor Force | 468,800 |
| Employment | 453,100 |
| Unemployment | 15,700 |
| Unemployment Rate | 3.4% |
| Total Nonfarm Jobs | 463,600 |

**Employment by Sector sub-table:**
Columns: Sector | Jobs (000s) | 12-Mo Change

List all major BLS sectors (Education & Health, Trade/Transport/Utilities, Professional Services, Government, Leisure & Hospitality, Manufacturing, Financial Activities, Mining/Logging/Construction, Other Services, Information). Include the 12-month percentage change for each.

**Section B: Demographic Data (Census)**
Columns: Metric | Value | Notes

Pull from Census QuickFacts (census.gov/quickfacts):
| Metric | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Population (latest) | Include growth since 2020 |
| Population Growth Rate | Annual rate |
| Median Age | |
| Median Household Income | Compare to national |
| Per Capita Income | |
| Poverty Rate | |
| Bachelor's Degree or Higher | Education level indicator |
| Owner-Occupied Housing | |
| Median Home Value (Census) | Note: ACS multi-year estimate |

**Section C: Housing Market (Redfin)**
Columns: Metric | Value | YoY Change

Pull from Redfin county page:
| Metric | Include |
|--------|---------|
| Median Sale Price | YoY change |
| Median Price/Sq Ft | YoY change |
| Homes Sold | YoY change |
| Median Days on Market | YoY change |
| Sale-to-List Price | YoY change (as percentage points) |
| Homes Above List Price | YoY change (as percentage points) |
| Homes with Price Drops | YoY change (as percentage points) |

---

#### Sheet 5: Crime & Safety

Crime data matters for investors because it directly impacts property values, insurance costs, and buyer pool. This sheet should make clear: Is the area getting safer or more dangerous? Which specific areas are higher risk?

**Section A: Crime Statistics**
Columns: Crime Type | Prior Year | Current Year | Change

Pull from local police department or FBI UCR data. Include:
- Murders
- Non-Fatal Shootings
- Robberies
- Motor Vehicle Thefts
- Car Burglaries
- Aggravated Assaults

Format the Change column as percentage: `-26%`, `+2%`

**Section B: Historical Murder Trend**
Columns: Year | Murders | Notes

Show 3-4 years of trend data. Murders are the most reliable crime stat (hardest to reclassify) and the strongest signal of neighborhood safety trajectory.

**Section C: Safety Assessment by Area**
Columns: Area | Safety Rating | Notes

Rate major sub-areas within the county (e.g., West Knoxville, North Knoxville, East Knoxville, Downtown, suburban areas) as High, Moderate, or Lower. Include brief context like `Lower crime, higher home values` or `Higher crime, but improving`.

**Section D: Key Insights for Investors**
Bullet-point rows (single column, merged) with 4-5 actionable observations connecting crime data to investment decisions. Examples:
- `Overall crime trending down significantly - positive for property values`
- `East Knoxville has higher crime but also higher investor activity`
- `Consider crime trends when evaluating neighborhood investments`

---

#### Sheet 6: Investment Recommendations

This is the action sheet — it translates all the data into specific, prioritized recommendations. An investor should be able to read this sheet alone and know exactly where to focus their marketing.

**Section A: Tier 1 - Highest Priority ZIP Codes**
Columns: ZIP Code | Inv Trans | Median Value | DOM | Rationale

Include 4-6 top ZIPs. The Rationale column should be a concise sentence explaining WHY this ZIP is Tier 1: `Highest activity, below-avg DOM, moderate prices`

**Section B: Tier 1 - Highest Priority Neighborhoods**
Columns: Neighborhood | Inv Trans | Median Value | DOM | Rationale

Include 4-6 top neighborhoods with specific rationale for each.

**Section C: Tier 2 - Secondary Opportunities**
Columns: ZIP Code | Inv Trans | Median Value | DOM | Rationale

Include 3-5 ZIPs that have merit but with caveats (higher prices, slower DOM, etc.).

**Section D: Market Timing Considerations**
Columns: Factor | Current Status | Implication

This helps investors understand whether NOW is a good time to enter the market:
| Factor | Example Status | Example Implication |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Price Trend | -2.9% YoY | Buyer's market, negotiate harder |
| Inventory | +9.7% sales volume | More deals available |
| Days on Market | 63 days (below national) | Market still moving |
| Competition | 18.6% above list | Less bidding wars than peak |
| Price Drops | 19.3% with reductions | Motivated sellers exist |

**Section E: Recommended Strategy**
Numbered rows (single column) with 5-7 specific, actionable steps. These should reference specific ZIP codes, neighborhoods, price ranges, and DOM thresholds from the data. Example:
1. `Focus marketing on 37920, 37914, 37917, 37921 ZIP codes`
2. `Target Colonial Village, Lonsdale, Vestal neighborhoods`
3. `Look for properties with 60+ DOM for motivated sellers`
4. `Target homes in $200K-$350K range for best wholesale margins`
